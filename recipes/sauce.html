        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Chimichurri sauce is a vibrant and tangy condiment originating
         from Argentina and Uruguay, known for its bold flavors and
         versatility. Typically used as a marinade or accompaniment for
         grilled meats, particularly beef, chimichurri combines fresh parsley
         garlic, oregano, and red pepper flakes, all finely chopped and mixed
         with olive oil, red or white wine vinegar, and a touch of salt.
         This uncooked sauce is celebrated for its refreshing and zesty
         taste, which enhances the rich, smoky flavors of grilled meats.</p>

         <p>The beauty of chimichurri lies in its simplicity and the
         freshness of its ingredients. It's a staple at Argentine asados
         (barbecues) and can also be drizzled over vegetables, used as a
         dressing for salads, or even spread on sandwiches for an extra 
         burst of flavor. While the traditional green chimichurri is the
         most common, there is also a red version, known as chimichurri 
         rojo, which includes paprika and sometimes tomatoes, adding a 
         different dimension to the sauce. Whether green or red, 
         chimichurri's bright and herbaceous profile makes it a 
         favorite in South American cuisine and beyond.</p>
