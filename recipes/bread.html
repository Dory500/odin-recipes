        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Brioche is a rich, buttery bread originating from France,
         renowned for its tender crumb and slightly sweet flavor. Characterized by a golden,
         flaky crust, brioche is made with a high proportion of eggs and butter, which gives 
         it a light, fluffy texture and a rich taste that sets it apart from other types of bread.
          Often enjoyed as a breakfast treat, it can be served plain, toasted, or used as the base 
          for luxurious French toast or bread pudding.</p>

        <p>Traditionally, brioche dough undergoes a long, slow fermentation, which enhances
         its flavor and texture. The dough is usually kneaded until smooth and elastic, then allowed 
         to rise before being shaped into rolls or loaves. Whether enjoyed fresh out of the oven or used in a
         variety of sweet and savory dishes, brioche's versatile and indulgent nature makes it a favorite 
         in bakeries and home kitchens alike.</p>
