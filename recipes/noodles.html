        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Lo mein noodles, a classic Chinese dish, are beloved for their versatility and rich,
        savory flavors.</p>
        <p>To prepare traditional lo mein, start by selecting the right type of noodles,
        ideally fresh egg noodles, which provide the perfect texture and taste.
        If fresh noodles are unavailable, dried egg noodles or even spaghetti can be used
        as a substitute. Begin by boiling the noodles until they are just tender,
        then drain and rinse them with cold water to stop the cooking process.
        This ensures the noodles remain firm and do not become mushy when stir-fried. Next,
        prepare a mix of colorful vegetables such as bell peppers, carrots, snow peas, and
        mushrooms, all sliced thinly to cook quickly and evenly.
        The vegetables should retain a bit of crunch to add texture to the dish.</p>

        <p>In a wok or large skillet, heat a generous amount of oil over high heat.
        Add minced garlic and ginger, cooking until fragrant, followed by thinly sliced protein
        of your choiceâ€”chicken, beef, shrimp, or tofu are popular options. Stir-fry until the
        protein is nearly cooked through, then add the vegetables. Cook everything together
        briefly before adding the noodles. The sauce, which typically includes soy sauce, oyster
        sauce, hoisin sauce, and a touch of sesame oil, is then poured over the noodles and
        tossed to coat everything evenly. The key to a great lo mein is in the tossing, ensuring
        each noodle is thoroughly mixed with the sauce and other ingredients. Finish with a
        prinkle of green onions and sesame seeds for garnish. Serve hot and enjoy a dish that is
        both hearty and satisfying, with layers of flavor in every bite.</p>
